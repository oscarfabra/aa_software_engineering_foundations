# A "Mersenne prime" is a prime number that is one less than a power of 2. 
# This means that it is a prime number with the form 2^x - 1, where x is some 
# exponent. For example:
# 3 is a Mersenne prime because it is prime and 3 = 2^2 - 1
# 7 is a Mersenne prime because it is prime and 7 = 2^3 - 1
# 11 is not a Mersenne prime because although it is prime, it does not have the 
# form 2^x - 1
# The first three Mersenne primes are 3, 7, and 31. The method that accepts a 
# number, n, as an argument and returns the n-th Mersenne prime.

# A triangular number is a number of the form (i * (i + 1)) / 2 where i is some
# positive integer. Substituting i with increasing integers gives the triangular
# number sequence. The first five numbers of the triangular number sequence are 
# 1, 3, 6, 10, 15. Below is a breakdown of the calculations used to obtain these
# numbers:
# i	(i * (i + 1)) / 2
# 1	1
# 2	3
# 3	6
# 4	10
# 5	15
# We can encode a word as a number by taking the sum of its letters based on 
# their position in the alphabet. For example, we can encode "cat" as 24 because
# c is the 3rd of the alphabet, a is the 1st, and t is the 20th:
# 3 + 1 + 20 = 24
# The method accepts a word as an argument and returns a boolean indicating 
# whether or not that word's number encoding is a triangular number. Assumes 
# that the argument contains lowercase letters.

# Accepts an array of numbers as an argument. The returns a new array that 
# results from continuously removing consecutive numbers that are adjacent in 
# the array. If multiple adjacent pairs are consecutive numbers, removes the 
# leftmost pair first. For example:
# [3, 4, 1] -> [1]
# because 3 and 4 are consecutive and adjacent numbers, so we can remove them
# [1, 4, 3, 7] -> [1, 7]
# because 4 and 3 are consecutive and adjacent numbers, so we can remove them
# [3, 4, 5] -> [5]
# because 4 and 3 are consecutive and adjacent numbers, we don't target 4 and 5 since we should prefer to remove the leftmost pair
# We can apply this rule repeatedly until we cannot collapse the array any further:
# # example 1
# [9, 8, 4, 5, 6] -> [4, 5, 6] -> [6]
# # example 2
# [3, 5, 6, 2, 1] -> [3, 2, 1] -> [1]

# Accepts an array and a number, n, as arguments. The method returns a new array 
# where each element of the original array is replaced according to the following
# rules:
# when the number argument is positive, replace an element with the n-th nearest
# prime number that is greater than the element
# when the number argument is negative, replace an element with the n-th nearest
# prime number that is less than the element
# For example:
# if element = 7 and n = 1, then the new element should be 11 because 11 is the 
# nearest prime greater than 7
# if the element = 7 and n = 2, then the new element should be 13 because 13 is 
# the 2nd nearest prime greater than 7
# if the element = 7 and n = -1, then the new element should be 5 because 5 is 
# the nearest prime less than 7
# if the element = 7 and n = -2, then the new element should be 3 because 3 is 
# the 2nd nearest prime less than 7
# Note that we will always be able to find a prime that is greater than a given
# number because there are an infinite number of primes (this is given by 
# Euclid's Theorem). However, we may be unable to find a prime that is smaller 
# than a given number, because 2 is the smallest prime. When a smaller prime 
# cannot be calculated, replace the element with nil.
